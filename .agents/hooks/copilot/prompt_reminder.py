"""Appends the preflight reminder to the prompt GitHub Copilot sends the model.

Copilot's userPromptTransformed event hands the hook a JSON payload on stdin
whose `transformedPrompt` field is the model-facing content, and replaces that
content with `modifiedTransformedPrompt` from the JSON the hook prints. See
https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/hooks-reference.

It lives in a subdirectory of .agents/hooks/ because the OpenCode and Kilo Code
runner discovers only the files sitting directly in that directory, so this
Copilot-only helper never costs their tool calls an interpreter start.

Copilot also fires the event for the prompt that opens a subagent's session,
and the payload names no agent. The CLI puts the subagentStart text at the
start of that prompt, so a prompt opening with it gets no reminder: the
reminder tells its reader to delegate, and a subagent told that turns its own
task away.

Every failure path prints nothing and exits 0, which Copilot reads as no
output and passes the prompt through unchanged.
