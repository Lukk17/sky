"""Shared preflight gate for every agent surface.

Reads one hook payload as JSON on stdin and decides whether a tool call may
proceed. Three rules:

A. The main thread may not write any file. It delegates the change to a
   subagent that owns the area. This covers the edit tools and the shell: a
   command is lexed and matched against the programs that write files, so
   reaching for sed, a redirection or a patch is not a way around the rule.
   Deleting, moving or renaming a directory that contains the repository,
   or the repository root itself, is a write of the repository too. The
   inner command of a wrapper (cmd /c or /k, sh -c and its kin, powershell
   or pwsh -Command or -EncodedCommand) is read the same way, and inline
   Python or JavaScript is read for the path it actually writes.
B. A subagent whose own definition declares no skills may not act. The caller
   spawns a specialist that declares its skills instead.
C. The main thread may not run a web fetch or web search tool directly, on
   the formats where that tool is known by name (currently Claude Code only,
   see RESEARCH_TOOLS). It spawns a subagent to do the research and report
   back instead.
D. The main thread may not run a script or a module, because the gate cannot
   see what a script writes. That is an interpreter handed a file or a module
   (python x.py, python -m x, node x.js, bash x.sh, pwsh -File x.ps1 and
   their kin), a package or task runner handed any subcommand (npm, npx,
   pnpm, yarn, uv, pip and their kin), a git subcommand that runs a command
   of its own, and a program invoked by a relative path or a script file
   name. The one exception is a command that matches an entry of
   MAIN_THREAD_ALLOWLIST, or of the project's own ALLOWLIST_FILE, in full.
   Inline code (python -c, node -e) is not a script run: the inline-code
   reader below judges it under Rule A instead.

Every rule above denies only once the caller is positively identified as the
main thread. A format whose payload carries nothing that could identify the
caller (currently Copilot, and a runner envelope with no is_subagent, see
_caller_identity) is left ungated rather than guessed at: denying blind risks
blocking a legitimate subagent as often as it blocks the main thread, and an
agent that cannot edit cannot work at all.

The output shape is picked with --format:

  claude, codex   PreToolUse JSON on stdout, exit 0
  copilot         flat permission JSON on stdout, exit 0
  plain           reason on stderr, exit 2

Claude Code, Codex and Copilot each call this script directly with their own
format. The plain format is the runner contract described at
https://github.com/Lukk17/agent-standards/blob/master/docs/hooks-contract.md,
which the OpenCode and Kilo Code plugin uses: one envelope on stdin, exit 2 to
deny.

Allowing prints nothing and exits 0 in every format. Any parse error, missing
key, or unexpected payload also allows: a broken gate must never break a
session. The one deliberate exception is the repository-boundary helpers
(_resolves_inside_repo, _path_exists_in_repo, _contains_repo): a path they
cannot resolve fails toward True, which denies rather than allows, because
the whole point of those helpers is to decide what Rule A protects. A write
the gate recognises but cannot place (nesting past _MAX_NESTING, code piped
from a program whose output it cannot read, an unreadable sourced file, a
process spawned from inline code) is treated the same way and denies.

Rule A protects a project, not the whole filesystem, and the boundary is
every root in _roots(): the process working directory, the project root the
payload names in its cwd field, and the gate's own on-disk location two
parents up. That last one counts only while it really is a project. The
user-level install in docs/GLOBAL_SETUP.md puts this script under the home
directory, where two parents up is the home directory itself, so it is
dropped there and only the project the session is in stays protected.

Rule A exempts exactly one path, TASK_LIST_NAME at the project root. The main
thread owns the task list, so it keeps writing that one file directly.

Arguments are scanned by hand rather than with argparse, because argparse
exits 2 on a usage error and 2 is the deny code in the plain format (see
docs/hooks-contract.md).
