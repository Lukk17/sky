"""Shared preflight gate for every agent surface.

Reads one hook payload as JSON on stdin and decides whether a tool call may
proceed. Three rules:

A. The main thread may not write any file. It delegates the change to a
   subagent that owns the area. This covers the edit tools and the shell: a
   command is lexed and matched against the programs that write files, so
   reaching for sed, a redirection or a patch is not a way around the rule.
B. A subagent whose own definition declares no skills may not act. The caller
   spawns a specialist that declares its skills instead.
C. The main thread may not run a web fetch or web search tool directly, on
   the formats where that tool is known by name (currently Claude Code only,
   see RESEARCH_TOOLS). It spawns a subagent to do the research and report
   back instead.

Every rule above denies only once the caller is positively identified as the
main thread. A format whose payload carries nothing that could identify the
caller (currently Copilot, see _caller_identity) is left ungated rather than
guessed at: denying blind risks blocking a legitimate subagent as often as it
blocks the main thread, and an agent that cannot edit cannot work at all.

The output shape is picked with --format:

  claude, codex   PreToolUse JSON on stdout, exit 0
  copilot         flat permission JSON on stdout, exit 0
  plain           reason on stderr, exit 2

Claude Code, Codex and Copilot each call this script directly with their own
format. The plain format is the runner contract described at
https://github.com/Lukk17/agent-standards/blob/master/docs/hooks-contract.md,
which the OpenCode and Kilo Code plugin uses: one envelope on stdin, exit 2 to
deny.

Allowing prints nothing and exits 0 in every format. Any parse error, missing
key, or unexpected payload also allows: a broken gate must never break a
session. The one deliberate exception is the repository-boundary helpers
(_resolves_inside_repo, _path_exists_in_repo): a path they cannot resolve
fails toward True, which denies rather than allows, because the whole point
of those helpers is to decide what Rule A protects.

Rule A protects a project, not the whole filesystem, and the boundary is
every root in _roots(): the process working directory, the project root the
payload names in its cwd field, and the gate's own on-disk location two
parents up. That last one counts only while it really is a project. The
user-level install in docs/GLOBAL_SETUP.md puts this script under the home
directory, where two parents up is the home directory itself, so it is
dropped there and only the project the session is in stays protected.

Rule A exempts exactly one path, TASK_LIST_NAME at the project root. The main
thread owns the task list, so it keeps writing that one file directly.

Arguments are scanned by hand rather than with argparse, because argparse
exits 2 on a usage error and 2 is the deny code in the plain format (see
docs/hooks-contract.md).
