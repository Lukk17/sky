name: database-migrations
description: Safe, reversible schema and data migrations for production databases, covering lock-free column and index changes, expand-contract renames, batched backfills, explicit constraint names, rollback strategy, and the review gates a migration must pass. Use when you say "add a column to this table", "create this index without downtime", "rename a column safely", "backfill ten million rows", or "how do we roll this migration back". Not for index choice and query tuning, use `postgres-patterns`.

# Database Migrations

Rules for changing a schema that is already carrying production traffic, where the failure mode is a locked table
rather than a compile error. The tool-specific commands live in the references. This file is the safety model every
tool has to satisfy.

Baseline versions, current as of September 2026: PostgreSQL 17, MySQL 8.4 LTS, and the migration tools named in the
reference map below.

---

### When to activate

- Creating or altering a table, column, index, or constraint on a live database.
- Backfilling or transforming existing rows.
- Planning a schema change that must survive a rolling deploy.
- Choosing or configuring migration tooling on a new project.
- Reviewing a migration before it reaches a production database.

---

### When not to activate

- Choosing an index type, reading a query plan, or tuning a slow query: use `postgres-patterns`.
- MongoDB document model and schema versioning: use `mongodb-patterns`.
- JPA and Hibernate entity mapping above the schema: use `springboot-patterns`.
- Deploy orchestration and rollback of the application itself: use `deployment-patterns`.
- Backup, restore, and retention policy: use `postgres-patterns`.

### Core principles

1. Every change is a migration. Never alter a production database by hand.
2. Production is forward-only. A rollback is a new forward migration, not a re-run of a down file.
3. Schema and data changes are separate migrations. Never mix DDL and DML in one file.
4. Test against production-sized data. A migration that runs on 100 rows can lock on 10 million.
5. A deployed migration is immutable. Editing one that has already run produces drift between environments.

### Add a column without rewriting the table

```sql
-- PASS: nullable column, metadata-only change
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN avatar_url TEXT;

-- PASS: PostgreSQL 15 or newer stores a constant default in the catalogue, so no rewrite happens
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true;

-- FAIL: NOT NULL with no default on an existing table rewrites every row under an exclusive lock
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN role TEXT NOT NULL;
```

To reach a NOT NULL column with no sensible default, take three steps: add it nullable, backfill in batches, then add
the constraint as `NOT VALID` and `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` separately, which takes a weaker lock.

---

### Build indexes concurrently

```sql
-- PASS
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_email ON users (email);

-- FAIL: blocks every write to the table for the duration of the build
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users (email);
```

`CONCURRENTLY` cannot run inside a transaction block, and most migration tools wrap each file in one, so the statement
needs its own migration and usually a tool-specific opt-out. A concurrent build that fails leaves an invalid index
behind: check `pg_index.indisvalid` and drop it before retrying.

---

### Rename with expand and contract, never in place

A rename is instantaneous for the database and fatal for the running application, because the old code and the new
schema overlap during any rolling deploy.

```sql
-- 001 expand: add the new column
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN display_name TEXT;

-- 002 backfill: separate data migration, batched
UPDATE users SET display_name = username WHERE display_name IS NULL;

-- deploy the application version that writes both and reads the new column

-- 003 contract: drop the old column once nothing references it
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN username;
```

Dropping a column follows the same order in reverse: remove every application reference, deploy, then drop.

---

### Backfill in bounded batches

```sql
-- FAIL: one transaction over every row, holding locks and bloating the WAL
UPDATE users SET normalized_email = LOWER(email);
```

```sql
-- PASS: bounded batches, each committed, skipping rows another worker holds
DO $$
DECLARE
  rows_updated INT;
BEGIN
  LOOP
    UPDATE users SET normalized_email = LOWER(email)
    WHERE id IN (
      SELECT id FROM users WHERE normalized_email IS NULL
      LIMIT 10000 FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
    );
    GET DIAGNOSTICS rows_updated = ROW_COUNT;
    EXIT WHEN rows_updated = 0;
    COMMIT;
  END LOOP;
END $$;
```

Make the batch resumable by selecting on the condition the update clears, so a killed backfill can simply be restarted.

---

### Name every constraint explicitly

An auto-generated name differs between environments and cannot be dropped reliably in a later migration.

```sql
ALTER TABLE orders
  ADD CONSTRAINT ck_orders_amount_positive CHECK (amount > 0),
  ADD CONSTRAINT uq_orders_reference UNIQUE (reference_number),
  ADD CONSTRAINT fk_orders_customer FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id);

CREATE INDEX ix_orders_status ON orders (status) WHERE status != 'completed';
```

Prefixes: `ck_` check, `uq_` unique, `fk_` foreign key, `ix_` index.

---

### Give every Liquibase changeset a rollback block

```xml
<changeSet id="20240101-add-status-column" author="dev">
    <addColumn tableName="orders">
        <column name="status" type="VARCHAR(20)" defaultValue="pending">
            <constraints nullable="false"/>
        </column>
    </addColumn>
    <rollback>
        <dropColumn tableName="orders" columnName="status"/>
    </rollback>
</changeSet>
```

Liquibase infers a rollback for some operations and silently does nothing for others, so write the block even when it
looks redundant. Use `context` to scope a changeset to an environment, for example seed data that must never reach
production.

---

### Preview the SQL before a production run

Generate the statements a run will execute and attach them to the change for review.

```bash
liquibase --changeLogFile=changelog.xml updateSQL > migration_preview.sql
```

Flyway offers the same thing through `-dryRunOutput`, but that flag is part of Flyway Teams and Enterprise, not the
community edition. On community Flyway, review the migration files themselves and rely on the staging run instead.

```bash
flyway -url=jdbc:postgresql://prod/db -dryRunOutput=migration_preview.sql migrate
```

Keep the preview as a CI artifact, and require a database owner to sign off whenever the change touches a table over a
million rows.

---

### Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE before the change lands

Two triggers, either one of which requires the plan in the change description:

- Any migration that touches data in an existing table, meaning `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT ... SELECT`, or a
  concurrent index build.
- Any query expected to touch more than 10,000 rows.

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE UPDATE orders SET status = 'active' WHERE created_at > '2024-01-01';
```

This is the same gate `postgres-patterns` states for query changes, deliberately worded identically so a change that
crosses both skills is reviewed once against one rule.

### Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails | Instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manual SQL in production | No audit trail, unrepeatable | Always a migration file |
| Editing a deployed migration | Environments drift silently | Write a new migration |
| NOT NULL with no default | Exclusive lock, full rewrite | Nullable, backfill, then validate |
| Inline index on a large table | Blocks writes during the build | `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` |
| Schema and data in one file | Long transaction, hard to roll back | Separate migrations |
| Dropping a column before removing the code | The running release errors | Remove references, deploy, then drop |
| Migration on application startup | Concurrent replicas race each other | One migration step in the deploy pipeline |

- `mongodb-patterns` for the document-model equivalent of these changes.
- `deployment-patterns` for sequencing a migration inside a rolling deploy.

- [ ] The migration has a down file, or is explicitly documented as irreversible.
- [ ] No statement takes a lock that blocks writes on a large table.
- [ ] New columns are nullable or carry a constant default.
- [ ] Indexes on existing tables are built concurrently, in their own migration.
- [ ] Renames and drops follow expand and contract across at least two deploys.
- [ ] Backfills are batched, committed per batch, and resumable.
- [ ] Every constraint and index has an explicit, prefixed name.
- [ ] The migration was run against a copy of production-sized data.
- [ ] `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output is attached when either trigger above applies.
- [ ] The rollback path is written down, not assumed.
