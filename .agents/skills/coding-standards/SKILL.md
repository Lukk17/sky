# Coding Standards & Best Practices

Baseline coding conventions applicable across projects.

This skill is the shared floor, not the detailed framework playbook.

- Use `frontend-patterns` for React, state, forms, rendering, and UI architecture.
- Use `backend-patterns` or `api-design` for repository/service layers, endpoint design, validation, and server-specific
  concerns.
- Use `rules/common/coding-style.md` when you need the shortest reusable rule layer instead of a full skill walkthrough.

---

### When to Activate

- Starting a new project or module
- Reviewing code for quality and maintainability
- Refactoring existing code to follow conventions
- Enforcing naming, formatting, or structural consistency
- Setting up linting, formatting, or type-checking rules
- Onboarding new contributors to coding conventions

---

### Scope Boundaries

Activate this skill for:
- descriptive naming
- immutability defaults
- readability, KISS, DRY, and YAGNI enforcement
- error-handling expectations and code-smell review

Do not use this skill as the primary source for:
- React composition, hooks, or rendering patterns
- backend architecture, API design, or database layering
- domain-specific framework guidance when a narrower ECC skill already exists

---

### Core principles

These are the engineering floor for every project. A request or an existing pattern that breaks one of them is a defect,
the same as a failing test. Say so and propose the version that respects them.

- SOLID. Single responsibility: one reason to change per class or function. Open for extension, closed for modification:
  add behaviour by extending, not by editing working code. Liskov substitution: a subtype works anywhere its base type
  is expected. Interface segregation: many small focused interfaces over one large one. Dependency inversion: depend on
  abstractions, never on concrete implementations.
- DRY. Every piece of knowledge has one source of truth. Extract shared logic into one well-named place. No copy-paste
  programming.
- KISS. The simplest solution that fully works wins. No cleverness for its own sake.
- YAGNI. Build only what is needed now. No speculative abstractions or configurability nobody asked for.
- FIRST for tests. Fast, isolated, repeatable, self-validating, and timely, written with the code and ideally before it.
- Favour composition over inheritance, immutable data over mutable state, and pure functions over hidden side effects.

The detailed testing playbook lives in the `tdd-workflow`, `python-testing`, `golang-testing`, and `springboot-tdd`
skills; this hub only states the principle.

---

### Naming and control flow

- Names explain themselves. Use descriptive, intention-revealing names for everything. If a piece of logic needs a
  comment to explain what it does, extract it into a well-named function instead.
- Functions use the verb-then-noun pattern (`calculateTotalRevenue`, `fetchMarketData`), never a bare noun or a single
  letter. Booleans start with `is`, `has`, or `can`.
- No magic numbers or strings. Extract them into named constants or configuration.
- Use guard clauses and early returns instead of deep nesting.
- Prefer an explicit type name over an inferred-type keyword where the language allows one, except where an idiom
  requires inference (for example Go short variable declarations).
- Use imports. Never write a fully-qualified name inline.
- Keep functions short and single-responsibility. A function much longer than a screen, or with five levels of nesting,
  is a smell to split.
- The codebase is English only. Translate any foreign-language name at the boundary.

#### 5. Functional Pipelines Over Imperative Cascades

When transforming a collection, filter, then map, then aggregate -
prefer a pipeline (one operation per step, top-down) over an
imperative `for` loop with `if`-`else` cascading and an explicit
accumulator. The pipeline reads as "what we're doing to the data";
the cascade reads as "how the bookkeeping goes."

This is a code-shape rule, not a syntax-level formatting one. The
sibling `code-formatter` skill says "one chain step per line"; this
skill says "reach for the chain in the first place."

##### Dart

```dart
// BAD — imperative cascade
final activeNames = <String>[];
for (final e in exercises) {
  if (e.isActive) {
    activeNames.add(e.name);
  }
}

// GOOD — pipeline
final activeNames = exercises
    .where((e) => e.isActive)
    .map((e) => e.name)
    .toList();
```

##### Java

Java's `Stream` API and `Optional` are explicitly designed for this.
A `for` + `if` + `list.add` block where a stream would do is a code
smell in modern Java.

```java
// BAD
List<String> activeNames = new ArrayList<>();
for (Exercise e : exercises) {
    if (e.isActive()) {
        activeNames.add(e.name());
    }
}

// GOOD
List<String> activeNames = exercises.stream()
    .filter(Exercise::isActive)
    .map(Exercise::name)
    .toList();

// Same principle for nullable values: reach for Optional, not if-null
// BAD
Exercise e = repository.findById(id);
if (e != null) {
    return e.name();
} else {
    return "unknown";
}

// GOOD
return repository.findById(id)
    .map(Exercise::name)
    .orElse("unknown");
```

##### Python

Python's idiomatic equivalent is a comprehension (or, for lazy
streams, a generator expression). Reach for them before you reach
for an explicit `for` + `if` + `list.append`.

```python
# BAD
active_names = []
for e in exercises:
    if e.is_active:
        active_names.append(e.name)

# GOOD
active_names = [e.name for e in exercises if e.is_active]

# When the transformation is heavier than a single expression, a
# generator + sum/max/min/any/all keeps the pipeline shape:
total_reps = sum(s.reps for s in series if s.reps > 0)
```

##### When NOT to convert

- Side effects inside the loop body (writing to disk, calling an API
  with an index-dependent argument, mutating an outside variable)
  belong in an explicit `for`, pipelines should be pure.
- Early termination on a complex condition that doesn't map to
  `takeWhile`/`first` cleanly.
- Cases where the cascade is genuinely clearer to a reader unfamiliar
  with the codebase's style, clarity outranks compactness.

The point is prefer, not always.

### Error handling and logging

- Never swallow an exception. Use specific, meaningful exception types, not generic ones, and never an empty catch that
  hides the failure.
- Handle errors in one central place rather than wrapping every method in its own try/catch. Let a global handler turn
  an error into the correct response.
- Chain exceptions so the original cause and its stack trace are preserved.
- Do not add error handling for situations that cannot happen.
- Return errors in a consistent, structured shape with a clear code and message. For a web service, map each error type
  to the correct status code and never leak internal detail (no stack trace, no disclosure of whether an account
  exists).
- Log through a single logging abstraction, never a concrete logging backend in business code. Use structured logging
  with meaningful levels and a correlation or trace identifier. Never log secrets, credentials, or personal data; mask
  sensitive fields.

The full logging and observability playbook lives in the `observability-and-logging` skill.

---

### Architecture

- Depend on abstractions and contracts, not on concrete implementations.
- Keep business logic separate from frameworks, from input and output, and from storage, so it can be tested on its own
  and moved without dragging the rest along.
- Layer the system and let dependencies point one way, toward the core. Enforce that direction with an automated check
  where the toolchain supports it.
- Inject dependencies through the constructor. Avoid hidden global state.
- Validate inputs at the entry of a method and fail fast on bad input.
- Model state explicitly. Represent something that can be in one of several states as exactly one of those states at a
  time, never as a loose bag of flags that can contradict each other.

The detailed ports-and-adapters treatment lives in the `hexagonal-architecture` skill.

---

### Feature flags

Gate risky, incomplete, or experimental work behind a feature flag rather than a long-lived branch that drifts from the
main line.

- Merge work into the main branch early, kept dark behind a flag, so integration stays continuous and each change is
  reviewed in small pieces.
- Give every flag a clear name, an owner, and a planned removal date. A flag is temporary scaffolding: delete it and its
  dead branches once the feature is fully shipped.
- Default a flag to off, and read its state from configuration so it can be turned on without a new deployment.
- Keep the flag check at the edge of the feature, in one place, rather than scattered through the code.

---

### Architecture decision records

Record every significant design decision as a short architecture decision record with the context, the decision, and the
consequences. Keep design rationale and decision history out of source files. The format and workflow live in the
`architecture-decision-records` skill.

---

### TypeScript/JavaScript Standards

#### Variable Naming

```typescript
// PASS: GOOD: Descriptive names
const marketSearchQuery = 'election'
const isUserAuthenticated = true
const totalRevenue = 1000

// FAIL: BAD: Unclear names
const q = 'election'
const flag = true
const x = 1000
```

#### Function Naming

```typescript
// PASS: GOOD: Verb-noun pattern
async function fetchMarketData(marketId: string) { }
function calculateSimilarity(a: number[], b: number[]) { }
function isValidEmail(email: string): boolean { }

// FAIL: BAD: Unclear or noun-only
async function market(id: string) { }
function similarity(a, b) { }
function email(e) { }
```

#### Immutability Pattern (CRITICAL)

```typescript
// PASS: ALWAYS use spread operator
const updatedUser = {
  ...user,
  name: 'New Name'
}

const updatedArray = [...items, newItem]

// FAIL: NEVER mutate directly
user.name = 'New Name'  // BAD
items.push(newItem)     // BAD
```

#### Error Handling

```typescript
// PASS: GOOD: Comprehensive error handling
async function fetchData(url: string) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url)

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}: ${response.statusText}`)
    }

    return await response.json()
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch data', { cause: error })
  }
}

// FAIL: BAD: No error handling
async function fetchData(url) {
  const response = await fetch(url)
  return response.json()
}
```

#### Async/Await Best Practices

```typescript
// PASS: GOOD: Parallel execution when possible
const [users, markets, stats] = await Promise.all([
  fetchUsers(),
  fetchMarkets(),
  fetchStats()
])

// FAIL: BAD: Sequential when unnecessary
const users = await fetchUsers()
const markets = await fetchMarkets()
const stats = await fetchStats()
```

#### Type Safety

```typescript
// PASS: GOOD: Proper types
interface Market {
  id: string
  name: string
  status: 'active' | 'resolved' | 'closed'
  created_at: Date
}

function getMarket(id: string): Promise<Market> {
  // Implementation
}

// FAIL: BAD: Using 'any'
function getMarket(id: any): Promise<any> {
  // Implementation
}
```

---

### Comments & Documentation

#### When to Comment

Default to no comments. Identifiers and structure already say what the code does. Add a comment only when the why is
non-obvious, a hidden invariant, a workaround for a specific defect with a stable external reference (CVE, RFC section),
or behavior that would surprise a future reader.

Do not write comments that reference ticket numbers, PR numbers, or review section numbers (`// PHA-270 fix`,
`// per review §4.4`, `// Regression guard for §1.1`). Nobody remembers what `§1.1` means six months later; the PR
description and commit message already carry that context. The one exception is a TODO tied to an open ticket:
`// TODO(PHA-265): <what's missing>`.

```typescript
// PASS: GOOD: Explain WHY, not WHAT
// Use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the API during outages
const delay = Math.min(1000 * Math.pow(2, retryCount), 30000)

// FAIL: BAD: Stating the obvious
// Increment counter by 1
count++

// Set name to user's name
name = user.name

// FAIL: BAD: Ticket / review-section references
// PHA-270 §4.4 — switch to ArrayList
// PR #15 review comment fix
// added for the cleanup pass
```

#### JSDoc for Public APIs

```typescript
/**
 * Searches markets using semantic similarity.
 *
 * @param query - Natural language search query
 * @param limit - Maximum number of results (default: 10)
 * @returns Array of markets sorted by similarity score
 * @throws {Error} If OpenAI API fails or Redis unavailable
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const results = await searchMarkets('election', 5)
 * console.log(results[0].name) // "Trump vs Biden"
 * ```
 */
export async function searchMarkets(
  query: string,
  limit: number = 10
): Promise<Market[]> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Performance

Measure before optimising, fix the one real bottleneck, avoid the N+1 query problem, fetch only the columns you need,
cache where reads dominate and staleness is tolerable, and run independent input and output work concurrently. The full
treatment lives in the `performance-optimization` skill.

---

### Testing Standards

#### Test Structure (AAA Pattern)

```typescript
test('calculates similarity correctly', () => {
  // Arrange
  const vector1 = [1, 0, 0]
  const vector2 = [0, 1, 0]

  // Act
  const similarity = calculateCosineSimilarity(vector1, vector2)

  // Assert
  expect(similarity).toBe(0)
})
```

#### Test Naming

```typescript
// PASS: GOOD: Descriptive test names
test('returns empty array when no markets match query', () => { })
test('throws error when OpenAI API key is missing', () => { })
test('falls back to substring search when Redis unavailable', () => { })

// FAIL: BAD: Vague test names
test('works', () => { })
test('test search', () => { })
```

---

### Code Smell Detection

Watch for these anti-patterns:

#### 1. Long Functions
```typescript
// FAIL: BAD: Function > 50 lines
function processMarketData() {
  // 100 lines of code
}

// PASS: GOOD: Split into smaller functions
function processMarketData() {
  const validated = validateData()
  const transformed = transformData(validated)
  return saveData(transformed)
}
```

#### 2. Deep Nesting
```typescript
// FAIL: BAD: 5+ levels of nesting
if (user) {
  if (user.isAdmin) {
    if (market) {
      if (market.isActive) {
        if (hasPermission) {
          // Do something
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

// PASS: GOOD: Early returns
if (!user) return
if (!user.isAdmin) return
if (!market) return
if (!market.isActive) return
if (!hasPermission) return

// Do something
```

#### 3. Magic Numbers
```typescript
// FAIL: BAD: Unexplained numbers
if (retryCount > 3) { }
setTimeout(callback, 500)

// PASS: GOOD: Named constants
const MAX_RETRIES = 3
const DEBOUNCE_DELAY_MS = 500

if (retryCount > MAX_RETRIES) { }
setTimeout(callback, DEBOUNCE_DELAY_MS)
```

Remember: Code quality is not negotiable. Clear, maintainable code enables rapid development and confident refactoring.
