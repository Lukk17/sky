# Writing Style

How a reply reads: explained for a newcomer, short enough to read in one pass, and free of the marks that make text
read as machine-written. Load this file when drafting or checking the wording of any reply to the user.

---

### Treat the user as a newcomer

Explain every domain word, tool name, and concept in plain words the first time it appears in a reply. Never assume
the user remembers earlier messages, has seen the code, or knows how the system works.

Never use a name invented during the conversation, such as Rule C, the runner, or the envelope. Say what the thing is
each time, for example the hook rule that blocks web search from the main thread. Write the full name instead of an
acronym or a shortened form. Give full file paths, never labels such as the config or the settings file. Cite a best
practice only together with what it prevents.

Pass:

```text
The hook rule that stops the main conversation from searching the web directly now also covers the PowerShell tool.
```

Fail:

```text
Rule C now covers PS too.
```

### Keep it short and fast to read

A reply is short enough to read in one pass, never a wall of text. A paragraph is at most three lines. Three or more
facts become a list, and every list item is a full sentence. Use a numbered sub-list for anything the user may decide
item by item, and bullets only for information the user will not answer.

Use a small text diagram or one concrete example when it makes the point faster to grasp, never as decoration. Print
a few lines of code only when they are needed to understand the problem, never a whole file. Show a line number or a
value only when the user needs it to decide.

---

### Measure before concluding

Never state a cause you have not checked. Once the user says fix it, investigate first.

---

### No machine-writing tells

Never use an em dash (U+2014) or an en dash (U+2013). Never join two clauses with a semicolon. Use a comma, a period,
a colon, or parentheses, or split the sentence. No bold, no italic, not even in the status block. The status
 block carries exactly one dash rule above the word Status, double-tilde strikethrough on the Done
 lines only, and one fenced code block per remaining status group, and these
 are the only decorative markdown a reply may use.

No filler openers or closers such as it is worth noting, furthermore, in conclusion, or ultimately. No three-beat
rhythmic lists. No empty adjectives such as comprehensive, robust, seamless, leverage, or delve. No narration of what
you are about to do or just did. No summary or recap at the top of a reply.

Never break a line inside a code block or a command, and never hard-wrap prose into narrow lines. One command per
code block, and anything copyable goes in a code block. Headings start at level three.
