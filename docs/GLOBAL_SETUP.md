# Global setup

Install the shared agent configuration once into your home directory so every project on the machine gets it, even the
ones that never ran the per-project import.

This is the counterpart to the per-project import in [AGENT_TOOLING.md](AGENT_TOOLING.md). The two are additive rather
than exclusive: an agent reads both scopes and merges them, so a project that also ran the per-project import keeps
winning on the paths where both scopes define the same thing.

Everything below is a command you run yourself, per agent, with a PowerShell version and a Unix-shell version of each
one. Take only the sections for the agents you actually run.

---

### What this is, and how it differs from the per-project setup

The per-project import drops files into a repository and commits them, so the whole team gets the same setup and the
files travel with the code. A global install writes into your home directory instead. Nothing is committed, nothing is
shared with anyone else, and every project you open on this machine picks it up without being touched.

That difference decides what belongs where.

Belongs globally, because it is the same for you in every repository:

- Skills. A skill such as `python-patterns` says nothing about one project, so one copy in the home directory serves
  every project. This is also the part with the biggest payoff, because most of the agents read the same
  `~/.agents/skills` directory.
- Subagents. Same reasoning. A `code-reviewer` definition is not project-specific.
- The preflight gate. The rule "name the skills and subagents that own this task before you start" is a working habit,
  not a project policy, so it is worth having in every session.
- Your personal instruction file, the parts of it that are about how you work rather than about one codebase.

Stays per project, because a global copy would be wrong or actively harmful:

- MCP servers that carry a connection string, a project token, or a service address. A Grafana URL or a SonarQube
  token belongs to the one project that owns it. Servers that really are machine-wide, Context7 and Playwright for
  example, are the exception and are fine globally.
- Anything that describes a codebase: its build commands, its module layout, its architecture decisions.
- The blocking half of the gate. Every shipped hook wiring calls `.agents/hooks/preflight_gate.py`, a
  project-relative path, on an interpreter it resolves itself, and the other hooks are wired the same way. Read
  [Limitations](#limitations) for exactly how far the global half gets.

---

### Prerequisites

You need `git`, and Python 3 for the hooks. Every script under `.agents/hooks/` is Python, and every wiring throws a
failed call away so a broken hook can never break a session, so a missing interpreter does not error: it allows every
call the gate was meant to block. Confirm one answers before you rely on any of it. PowerShell:

```powershell
python --version
```

Unix shell:

```bash
python3 --version
```

Several steps below create a symlink, so on Windows do both of these before you start.

Turn on Developer Mode in Settings, System, For developers. Without it, creating a symlink needs an elevated shell.
Claude Code's own documentation says the same thing about symlinking `CLAUDE.md`
([memory docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory)).

Tell git to honour symlinks, so the clone in step 1 writes real links rather than text files holding a path.
PowerShell:

```powershell
git config --global core.symlinks true
```

Unix shell:

```bash
git config --global core.symlinks true
```

PowerShell has no `ln`. Use `New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink`, which is the only command that makes a real symlink.
`New-Item -ItemType Junction` and a shortcut file are not the same thing, and the agents will not follow them.

If you would rather run the Unix-shell blocks under Git Bash on Windows, tell the MSYS runtime to make real symlinks
first, because that is not its default. Put this in the session before you start, or in your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export MSYS=winsymlinks:nativestrict
```

Without that setting `ln -s` silently copies the target, so `~/.claude/skills` becomes a stale snapshot of the skills
tree instead of a live link to it, and an update stops reaching it.

WSL works too, but read what it installs into before you pick it. Inside WSL, `$HOME` is the Linux home, so the
install lands there and a Windows-side agent never sees it. Use WSL only if the agents you run are the ones inside it.

On Windows, `~` and `$HOME` in this document both mean `%USERPROFILE%`, so `~/.claude` means `%USERPROFILE%\.claude`
([Claude Code settings](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings)).

---

### Step 1, one shared checkout

Clone this repository once into a working location in your home directory. The clone is the staging area, not the live
configuration: later steps copy or link out of it, and the update section pulls new commits into it.

The clone is sparse and blobless, so only the directories the agents actually need come down. Cone mode also brings
every file in the repository root along, which is how `AGENTS.md.example` arrives.

PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/Lukk17/agent-standards.git $HOME\.agent-standards
```

Unix shell:

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/Lukk17/agent-standards.git ~/.agent-standards
```

Select the directories. PowerShell:

```powershell
git -C $HOME\.agent-standards sparse-checkout set .agents .claude .codex .github .kilo .opencode docs
```

Unix shell:

```bash
git -C ~/.agent-standards sparse-checkout set .agents .claude .codex .github .kilo .opencode docs
```

Stop the clone pushing anywhere by accident. PowerShell:

```powershell
git -C $HOME\.agent-standards remote set-url --push origin no_push
```

Unix shell:

```bash
git -C ~/.agent-standards remote set-url --push origin no_push
```

---

### Step 2, the one shared tree every agent reads

Create the shared directory. PowerShell:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force $HOME\.agents
```

Unix shell:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents
```

Copy the canonical content into it. This is `skills/`, the OpenCode-format `agents/` tree, the four `hooks/`
scripts (the preflight gate, the reply formatting check, the task-list mirror, and the markdown lint pass), and
the `plugin/` shim, all in one move. PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force $HOME\.agent-standards\.agents\* $HOME\.agents\
```

Unix shell:

```bash
cp -R ~/.agent-standards/.agents/. ~/.agents/
```

After this one step, Codex, OpenCode, and GitHub Copilot already see every skill, with no further wiring. Claude Code
needs a symlink and Kilo Code needs one config line, both covered in their sections below.

`preflight_gate.py` guards only the project a session is open in and never your home directory at large: it takes the
project root from the hook payload's own `cwd` field and from the working directory, and it ignores its own on-disk
location once that location is your home directory rather than a project.

Three of those four hook scripts get wired per agent below. The fourth, `markdown_lint_check.py`, does not: it shells
out to `tools/check-markdown.py`, which stays in the upstream repository and never ships, so a global wiring would
start an interpreter that returns 0 every time. It is copied anyway, because the copy is one directory rather than a
file list, and it costs nothing sitting there unwired.

`task_list_sync.py` mirrors the agent's own task list into a file named `tasks.md` so a compaction cannot lose it. It
writes that file at the project root when the working directory has an imported `.agents/hooks/` beside it, and in
your home directory when it does not, which is what a bare directory gets. Add `tasks.md` to your global gitignore if
you would rather it never showed up as an untracked file.

Now put your machine-wide instruction file where the agents can find it. `AGENTS.md.example` is written for a project,
so treat it as a starting point and cut the project-specific sections out of the global copy, leaving the parts that
describe how you want to work everywhere. PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item $HOME\.agent-standards\AGENTS.md.example $HOME\.agents\AGENTS.md
```

Unix shell:

```bash
cp ~/.agent-standards/AGENTS.md.example ~/.agents/AGENTS.md
```

Nothing reads `~/.agents/AGENTS.md` on its own. Each per-agent section below points its agent at this one file, so the
text lives in one place instead of five.

---

### Per-agent setup

Every subsection assumes steps 1 and 2 are done. Take only the subsections for the agents you actually run. Adding a
second agent later is nothing more than running its subsection too, because the shared tree is the same files.

#### Claude Code

Claude Code is the one agent that reads neither `AGENTS.md` nor `~/.agents/skills`. Its personal skills location is
`~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` ([skills docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)), so the shared tree
reaches it through a symlink, exactly as the per-project setup does. Personal subagents live in `~/.claude/agents/`
([sub-agents docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents)), user hooks and settings in `~/.claude/settings.json`,
and personal instructions in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` ([memory docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory)).

Create the parent directory first, because the symlink command will not make it for you. PowerShell:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force $HOME\.claude
```

Unix shell:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude
```

Link the skills. PowerShell:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path $HOME\.claude\skills -Target $HOME\.agents\skills
```

Unix shell:

```bash
ln -s ~/.agents/skills ~/.claude/skills
```

The documentation guarantees the symlink is followed for a `<skill-name>` entry inside the skills directory, and says
Claude Code loads a skill once even when the same target is reachable from two locations. Linking the whole `skills`
directory in one go, which is what the command above does and what the per-project setup does, is not spelled out in
the documentation. If it ever stops working, fall back to one symlink per skill directory, which is the documented
shape.

Copy the subagents. PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force $HOME\.agent-standards\.claude\agents $HOME\.claude\
```

Unix shell:

```bash
cp -R ~/.agent-standards/.claude/agents ~/.claude/
```

Point Claude Code at the shared instructions by adding one import line to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Imports in a
user-scope memory file load without the external-import approval dialog, because that file is one you wrote yourself.

```text
@~/.agents/AGENTS.md
```

Wire the hooks into `~/.claude/settings.json`. Hooks in that file apply to every project on the machine
([hooks docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks)). Replace every absolute path with your real home directory.
Forward slashes work on Windows too and save you escaping backslashes inside JSON.

This is the same event set the per-project wiring uses, minus the markdown lint pass. `SessionStart` and
`UserPromptSubmit` inject the gate text, `PreToolUse` is the blocking half, `Stop` and `SubagentStop` check the reply
formatting, and the five task events keep `tasks.md` in step. Each command resolves its own interpreter, `python3`
first and `python` second, because Debian and Ubuntu ship no `python` and the python.org Windows installer ships
no `python3`. `-S -E` skips site initialisation and ignores the
`PYTHON*` environment variables, which is safe because every hook is standard library only and saves a slice of
interpreter start on every single tool call. The trailing `; exit 0` is what turns a missing or broken hook back into
an allow, in the one form both bash and PowerShell parse, because Claude Code has a single command field and picks the
shell itself.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {

          },
          {
            "type": "command",
            "timeout": 10,
            "command": "PY=$(command -v python3 || command -v python) && \"$PY\" -S -E /home/you/.agents/hooks/task_list_sync.py --event stop --format claude ; exit 0"

          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If you already have a `~/.claude/settings.json`, merge the `hooks` block into it rather than overwriting the file.

MCP at user scope is stored in `~/.claude.json`, and the supported way to write it is the CLI rather than hand-editing
([MCP docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp)). One server per command, so add only the ones that genuinely are
machine-wide. PowerShell:

```powershell
claude mcp add --transport http context7 --scope user https://mcp.context7.com/mcp
```

Unix shell:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http context7 --scope user https://mcp.context7.com/mcp
```

#### Codex

Codex needs the least work of the five. It scans `$HOME/.agents/skills` for skills natively and follows symlinked
skill folders while scanning ([build skills](https://learn.chatgpt.com/codex/build-skills)), so step 2 finished the
skills job. There is no `~/.codex/skills` in the documentation at all.

Create the configuration directory. PowerShell:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force $HOME\.codex
```

Unix shell:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex
```

Copy the TOML subagents into `~/.codex/agents/`
([subagents](https://learn.chatgpt.com/codex/agent-configuration/subagents)). PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force $HOME\.agent-standards\.codex\agents $HOME\.codex\
```

Unix shell:

```bash
cp -R ~/.agent-standards/.codex/agents ~/.codex/
```

Give Codex the shared instructions. It reads `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`
([AGENTS.md docs](https://learn.chatgpt.com/codex/agent-configuration/agents-md)). PowerShell:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path $HOME\.codex\AGENTS.md -Target $HOME\.agents\AGENTS.md
```

Unix shell:

```bash
ln -s ~/.agents/AGENTS.md ~/.codex/AGENTS.md
```

Wire the hooks in `~/.codex/hooks.json`, which is the user-level hooks file
([hooks docs](https://learn.chatgpt.com/codex/hooks)). The same tables can go inline in `~/.codex/config.toml` instead,
and Codex asks you to pick one form per configuration layer rather than using both. Replace every absolute path. All
five events matter: `UserPromptSubmit` and `SubagentStart` inject the text, on the main thread and inside a subagent,
`PreToolUse` is the blocking half, `Stop` checks the reply formatting, and `SessionStart` puts the task list back.
Leave `SubagentStart` out and a subagent gets no gate at all. The `|| exit 0` on every script command is what makes a
missing or broken script allow the call instead of denying every one of them, and each command needs its
`commandWindows` sibling because Codex picks one of the two per platform and a command with no sibling is simply
absent on the other.

          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

MCP servers go in `[mcp_servers.<name>]` tables in `~/.codex/config.toml`, which is shared by the Codex CLI, the IDE
extension, and the ChatGPT desktop app ([MCP docs](https://learn.chatgpt.com/codex/extend/mcp)). Copy the tables you
want from [MCP_SETUP.md](MCP_SETUP.md).

#### OpenCode

OpenCode reads `~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` natively as one of its skill locations, so step 2 finished that too
([skills docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/skills/)). It also reads `~/.claude/skills`, which means the Claude Code
symlink from the previous section is a second route to the same files. OpenCode loads a skill from whichever location
it finds it in, so there is nothing to undo.

Create the configuration directory. PowerShell:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force $HOME\.config\opencode\plugins
```

Unix shell:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/plugins
```

Copy the OpenCode-format subagents into the documented global location, `~/.config/opencode/agents/`
([agents docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/agents/)). PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force $HOME\.agents\agents $HOME\.config\opencode\agents
```

Unix shell:

```bash
cp -R ~/.agents/agents ~/.config/opencode/agents
```

Install the gate plugin. Files in `~/.config/opencode/plugins/` load automatically at startup
([plugins docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/plugins/)). PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item $HOME\.agents\plugin\hooks.js $HOME\.config\opencode\plugins\hooks.js
```

Unix shell:

```bash
cp ~/.agents/plugin/hooks.js ~/.config/opencode/plugins/hooks.js
```

Read the [Limitations](#limitations) section before you rely on this one. The plugin looks for the gate scripts under
the project directory it was started in, so a global copy stays silent in a project that has no `.agents/hooks/`.

Give OpenCode the shared instructions. Its global rules file is `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`
([rules docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/rules/)). PowerShell:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path $HOME\.config\opencode\AGENTS.md -Target $HOME\.agents\AGENTS.md
```

Unix shell:

```bash
ln -s ~/.agents/AGENTS.md ~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md
```

MCP servers and any extra `instructions` entries go under the `mcp` and `instructions` keys of
`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` ([config docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/config/)). Take the `mcp` block from
[MCP_SETUP.md](MCP_SETUP.md) and keep the machine-wide servers only.

#### Kilo Code

Kilo Code is the one agent where the shared skills tree is not automatic. Its documented global skill locations are
`~/.kilo/skills/` and `~/.claude/skills/`, the second only when Claude Code Compatibility is turned on. A
home-directory `~/.agents/skills` is not on that list, and `.agents/skills/` is documented as a project-relative
compatibility directory only ([skills docs](https://kilo.ai/docs/customize/skills)).

Create the configuration directory. PowerShell:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force $HOME\.config\kilo\plugin
```

Unix shell:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/kilo/plugin
```

The documented way to add the shared tree is the `skills.paths` key, which accepts `~/` home-relative paths. Put this
in `~/.config/kilo/kilo.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  "skills": {
    "paths": ["~/.agents/skills"]
  }
}
```

Copy the OpenCode-format subagents into `~/.config/kilo/agents/`
([custom subagents](https://kilo.ai/docs/customize/custom-subagents)). PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force $HOME\.agents\agents $HOME\.config\kilo\agents
```

Unix shell:

```bash
cp -R ~/.agents/agents ~/.config/kilo/agents
```

Install the same gate plugin. Kilo's global plugin directory is `~/.config/kilo/plugin/`, and it accepts an
OpenCode-format plugin unchanged ([plugins docs](https://kilo.ai/docs/automate/extending/plugins)). PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item $HOME\.agents\plugin\hooks.js $HOME\.config\kilo\plugin\hooks.js
```

Unix shell:

```bash
cp ~/.agents/plugin/hooks.js ~/.config/kilo/plugin/hooks.js
```

Kilo Code reads no global `AGENTS.md`. Global rules come from the `instructions` key of the global config file
([custom rules](https://kilo.ai/docs/customize/custom-rules)), so point that at the shared file. Merge this into the
same `~/.config/kilo/kilo.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  "instructions": ["~/.agents/AGENTS.md"],
  "mcp": {}
}
```

MCP servers go under the `mcp` key of that file, in the same shape as `opencode.json`
([CLI docs](https://kilo.ai/docs/code-with-ai/platforms/cli)). `{env:VAR}` does work here. Kilo refuses environment
references in a project config file, and rejects the whole file when it finds one, but the global config is trusted
and expands them normally, in `environment` blocks and in remote `headers` alike. This is the place to put the
Context7 API key header if you want Kilo to use your key rather than the free tier, and an MCP entry has to be a
complete server block, since a partial override fails validation:

```jsonc
{
  "mcp": {
    "context7": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp",
      "headers": { "CONTEXT7_API_KEY": "{env:CONTEXT7_API_KEY}" },
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

#### GitHub Copilot

Copilot reads `~/.agents/skills` as a personal skills location alongside `~/.copilot/skills`
([about agent skills](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-agent-skills)), so step 2 finished the
skills job here too, across the cloud agent, code review, the CLI, the Copilot app, and agent mode in VS Code and
JetBrains.

Everything else on this list is CLI-only. The CLI configuration directory is `~/.copilot`, relocatable with
`COPILOT_HOME`
([CLI config dir reference](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/copilot-cli-reference/cli-config-dir-reference)).

Create the two directories the copies land in. PowerShell:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force $HOME\.copilot\agents, $HOME\.copilot\hooks
```

Unix shell:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.copilot/agents ~/.copilot/hooks
```

Copy the `*.agent.md` subagents into `~/.copilot/agents/`. PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force $HOME\.agent-standards\.github\agents\* $HOME\.copilot\agents\
```

Unix shell:

```bash
cp -R ~/.agent-standards/.github/agents/. ~/.copilot/agents/
```

Copy the gate into the user-level hooks directory, `~/.copilot/hooks/`
([hooks reference](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/hooks-reference)). PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item $HOME\.agent-standards\.github\hooks\preflight.json $HOME\.copilot\hooks\preflight.json
```

Unix shell:

```bash
cp ~/.agent-standards/.github/hooks/preflight.json ~/.copilot/hooks/preflight.json
```

Then open the copy and make both script paths absolute: the two `preToolUse` commands name
`.agents/hooks/preflight_gate.py` and the second `sessionStart` command names `.agents/hooks/task_list_sync.py`, each
of them relative. Put `~/.agents/hooks/` in front of both names, spelled out in full, or those hooks only work in
projects that ran the per-project import. The file wires no reply formatting check, because Copilot has no confirmed
event for one.

Personal instructions live in `~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md`. Point it at the shared file. PowerShell:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path $HOME\.copilot\copilot-instructions.md -Target $HOME\.agents\AGENTS.md
```

Unix shell:

```bash
ln -s ~/.agents/AGENTS.md ~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md
```

The CLI also honours `COPILOT_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS_DIRS`, a comma-separated list of directories it searches for an
`AGENTS.md`. Setting it to `~/.agents` is the alternative to the symlink above, and it needs no Developer Mode on
Windows.

MCP for the CLI is `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`. In VS Code, run the `MCP: Open User Configuration` command to open the
`mcp.json` in your user profile folder, which applies across every workspace. The JetBrains plugin is global-only and
GitHub documents the in-IDE user interface rather than the path, so no file is given here. The manual blocks for both
are in [MCP_SETUP.md](MCP_SETUP.md).

---

### What this document deliberately leaves to you

1. MCP servers, everywhere. Which servers are machine-wide is a judgement about your machine, and most servers should
   not be global at all. Each agent's subsection above says where its user-scope MCP configuration lives, and
   [MCP_SETUP.md](MCP_SETUP.md) has the blocks.
2. The content of `~/.agents/AGENTS.md`. Step 2 copies the project template there once. Editing it down to the parts
   that are about you is a job only you can do.
3. Merging into a configuration file you already have. Nothing above tells you to overwrite one. Where a file already
   exists, merge the block rather than replacing the file.

---

### Global path map

Every global location this document touches, per agent. The project-level equivalents are the paths the import
writes into your repository, and they are unaffected by anything here.

| Agent | Skills | Subagents | Hooks or plugin | MCP config | Global instructions | Config-dir env var |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/`, reached by symlink to `~/.agents/skills` | `~/.claude/agents/` | `hooks` in `~/.claude/settings.json` | `~/.claude.json`, written by `claude mcp add --scope user` | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, plus `~/.claude/rules/` | `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` |
| Codex | `$HOME/.agents/skills` native, also `/etc/codex/skills` | `~/.codex/agents/` as TOML | `~/.codex/hooks.json`, or inline `[[hooks.*]]` in `~/.codex/config.toml` | `[mcp_servers.*]` in `~/.codex/config.toml` | `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, override `~/.codex/AGENTS.override.md` | `CODEX_HOME` |
| OpenCode | `~/.agents/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.config/opencode/skills/`, all native | `~/.config/opencode/agents/` | `~/.config/opencode/plugins/`, or the `plugin` key in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` | `mcp` key in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` | `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`, falls back to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR`, and `OPENCODE_CONFIG` for the file |
| Kilo Code | `~/.kilo/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/` behind a compatibility setting, plus anything in `skills.paths` | `~/.config/kilo/agents/` | `~/.config/kilo/plugin/` | `mcp` key in `~/.config/kilo/kilo.jsonc` | none, use `instructions` in `~/.config/kilo/kilo.jsonc` | NOT DOCUMENTED |
| GitHub Copilot | `~/.copilot/skills/` and `~/.agents/skills/`, both native | `~/.copilot/agents/`, CLI only | `~/.copilot/hooks/`, CLI only | `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` for the CLI, user-profile `mcp.json` for VS Code | `~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md`, or `COPILOT_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS_DIRS` | `COPILOT_HOME` |

---

### The unification story

Three of the five agents read `~/.agents/skills` straight out of the box: Codex, OpenCode, and every GitHub Copilot
surface that supports skills. For those three, step 2 is the entire skills installation.

Claude Code does not read it. Its only personal skills location is `~/.claude/skills`, so it needs the symlink. That is
the same bridge the per-project setup uses, for the same reason.

Kilo Code does not read it either, at least not from the home directory. It reads `~/.kilo/skills` and, with the
compatibility setting on, `~/.claude/skills`. The documented `.agents/skills` support is project-relative. So Kilo gets
one line of config, `skills.paths`, which the documentation says accepts a `~/` path. If you would rather avoid the
config edit, turning on Claude Code Compatibility makes Kilo read `~/.claude/skills`, which the Claude Code symlink has
already pointed at the shared tree.

What cannot be shared, and why:

- Subagents. There is no shared subagent format. Claude Code takes its own markdown, Codex takes TOML, Copilot takes
  `*.agent.md`, and OpenCode and Kilo take OpenCode-format markdown in two different directories. Every global install
  is therefore a copy into a per-agent directory. OpenCode and Kilo could share one tree through a symlink the way the
  project setup does, but neither documents following a symlinked agents directory, so this document copies instead.
- Hooks. Five different schemas, five different event vocabularies, five different files. The wording is identical
  everywhere, the wiring never is.
- MCP. Five schemas again, and the environment-variable substitution syntax differs in each. That one is a smaller loss
  than it looks, because most servers should not be global anyway.
- Instructions. One file can be shared, and this document shares it, but each agent needs its own pointer at it: an
  `@` import for Claude Code, a symlink for Codex, OpenCode, and the Copilot CLI, and a config key for Kilo Code.

---

### Updating the global installation

Everything above either copies out of `~/.agent-standards` or links into `~/.agents`. Updating means refreshing the
clone, then refreshing only the trees you have not edited yourself.

Fetch and fast-forward the clone. PowerShell:

```powershell
git -C $HOME\.agent-standards pull --ff-only
```

Unix shell:

```bash
git -C ~/.agent-standards pull --ff-only
```

Refresh the shared tree. Both commands copy over the top rather than wiping first, so a skill you wrote yourself under
`~/.agents/skills` survives, while an upstream skill you edited in place is overwritten. If you have local edits worth
keeping, copy them somewhere else before running this. PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force $HOME\.agent-standards\.agents\* $HOME\.agents\
```

Unix shell:

```bash
cp -R ~/.agent-standards/.agents/. ~/.agents/
```

Refresh Claude Code's subagents. The `skills` symlink needs nothing, because it follows the directory it points at.
PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force $HOME\.agent-standards\.claude\agents $HOME\.claude\
```

Unix shell:

```bash
cp -R ~/.agent-standards/.claude/agents ~/.claude/
```

Refresh Codex's subagents. PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force $HOME\.agent-standards\.codex\agents $HOME\.codex\
```

Unix shell:

```bash
cp -R ~/.agent-standards/.codex/agents ~/.codex/
```

Refresh the Copilot CLI's subagents. PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force $HOME\.agent-standards\.github\agents\* $HOME\.copilot\agents\
```

Unix shell:

```bash
cp -R ~/.agent-standards/.github/agents/. ~/.copilot/agents/
```

Refresh the OpenCode subagents from the shared tree you just updated. PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force $HOME\.agents\agents\* $HOME\.config\opencode\agents\
```

Unix shell:

```bash
cp -R ~/.agents/agents/. ~/.config/opencode/agents/
```

Run the same pair against Kilo Code's directory. PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force $HOME\.agents\agents\* $HOME\.config\kilo\agents\
```

Unix shell:

```bash
cp -R ~/.agents/agents/. ~/.config/kilo/agents/
```

Never refreshed by any command above, on purpose, because they become yours the moment you install them:
`~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude.json`, `~/.codex/hooks.json`, `~/.codex/config.toml`,
`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`, `~/.config/kilo/kilo.jsonc`, `~/.copilot/hooks/preflight.json`,
`~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`, and `~/.agents/AGENTS.md`. When upstream changes the gate wording or adds an MCP server,
merge it into those by hand.

A deleted skill is the one case the copy commands get wrong: they bring back anything you removed on purpose. Once you
start curating the set, use the selective approach in [AGENTS-UPDATE.md](AGENTS-UPDATE.md), which enumerates what is
already on disk and refreshes only that.

---

### Undoing the global installation

Remove it by hand, in this order, checking each directory before you delete it. Every directory the install writes into
is a directory an agent also lets you put your own files in, so deleting a whole tree takes anything you wrote yourself
along with the imported files.

Delete the shared checkout, which nothing but this install owns. PowerShell:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force $HOME\.agent-standards
```

Unix shell:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.agent-standards
```

Delete the shared tree. This also removes `~/.agents/AGENTS.md`, so move that aside first if you edited it into
something you want to keep. PowerShell:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force $HOME\.agents
```

Unix shell:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.agents
```

Then, per agent, remove only what you recognise: the `agents/` directory, the plugin file, the `skills` symlink, and
the pointer at the shared instruction file. The [Global path map](#global-path-map) above lists every one of them.
Take the gate out of `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.codex/hooks.json`, and `~/.copilot/hooks/preflight.json` by
editing those files, since each may hold configuration of yours as well, and take the `@~/.agents/AGENTS.md` line out
of `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

Removing `~/.claude/skills` needs one bit of care. It is a symlink, so delete the link itself and not the tree behind
it. PowerShell:

```powershell
(Get-Item $HOME\.claude\skills).Delete()
```

Unix shell:

```bash
rm ~/.claude/skills
```

---

### Limitations

Honest list of what a global install cannot do.

1. The blocking half of the preflight gate is project-shaped. Every shipped hook wiring calls
   `.agents/hooks/preflight_gate.py`, resolved against the session's working directory. At user level you
   have to rewrite that to an absolute path, which the Claude Code, Codex, and Copilot sections above tell you to do,
   and the same is true of `.agents/hooks/task_list_sync.py` and `.agents/hooks/no_ai_markers_check.py`. The gate
   script then looks for subagent definitions in both the current directory and its own grandparent, so a copy at
   `~/.agents/hooks/preflight_gate.py` does find `~/.claude/agents` and `~/.agents/agents`. The text-injection half,
   the `echo` that reminds the model to name its skills, has no file dependency and works globally as it ships.

2. The OpenCode and Kilo Code plugin cannot be fixed the same way. It resolves the gate scripts against the project
   directory it is handed at startup and allows the call when the file is missing, by design, so that a broken gate
   never breaks a session. A global copy of that plugin is therefore a no-op in any project that has not run the
   per-project import. Making it work globally means editing the two path constants at the top of `hooks.js` to
   absolute paths, which this document does not tell you to do, because it writes your home directory into a file the
   update step overwrites.

3. GitHub Copilot's hooks exist only in the CLI and the cloud agent. VS Code, JetBrains, and Copilot code review get no
   hook surface at all, so there is no global gate for them and no project-level one either. They still read
   `~/.agents/skills` and the instruction files, so the advisory half of the gate reaches them as prose.

4. The Copilot cloud agent reads hooks only from `.github/hooks/*.json` in the cloned repository. Nothing in your home
   directory reaches it, by definition, because it runs on GitHub's machines.

5. Claude Code Cowork sessions and cloud sessions do not read `~/.claude/skills` on your machine at all. Cowork loads
   the skills enabled for your claude.ai account, and cloud sessions additionally load project skills from the cloned
   repository. Cowork also skips a `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` that is itself a symlink, and skips imports in a user-scope
   file that resolve outside the session's working directory, which is exactly what `@~/.agents/AGENTS.md` does. So the
   global install covers your local sessions and not those two.

6. Kilo Code documents no environment variable that relocates its whole configuration directory. `KILO_CONFIG` and
   `KILO_CONFIG_CONTENT` pass configuration content rather than moving the directory. The other four agents all have
   one: `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME`, `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR`, and `COPILOT_HOME`.

7. Symlink behaviour is documented for two agents and merely observed for the rest. Claude Code documents that a
   `<skill-name>` entry may be a symlink, and that `.claude/rules/` supports them. Codex documents that it follows
   symlinked skill folders. OpenCode, Kilo Code, and GitHub Copilot document nothing either way, and no agent documents
   following a symlinked subagents directory. Where this document needs a subagent tree in two places it copies rather
   than links.

8. Project settings win. A project that ran the per-project import brings its own `.claude/settings.json`,
   `opencode.json`, `.codex/config.toml`, and skills, and those take precedence over the global ones. That is the
   correct behaviour, and it means the global install is a floor rather than a policy.
