# Agent Standards and OpenSpec

This project imports a central set of AI agent standards from a shared repository:

- Skills in [.agents/skills/](../.agents/skills/): reusable procedural guidance. Codex, OpenCode, Kilo Code, and
  every GitHub Copilot surface read this directory natively. Claude Code reaches it through a symlink. Each skill
  carries standard front matter (`name`, `description`, and optionally `license` or `compatibility`) per the open
  [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification), and its description names the phrases that
  should trigger it.
- Subagents generated into [.claude/agents/](../.claude/agents/) (Claude markdown),
  [.agents/agents/](../.agents/agents/) (OpenCode markdown, shared by OpenCode and Kilo Code through symlinks),
  [.codex/agents/](../.codex/agents/) (TOML), and [.github/agents/](../.github/agents/) (`*.agent.md`).
- Instructions in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md): shared rules read natively by Codex, OpenCode, Kilo Code, and GitHub
  Copilot, and imported into Claude Code through [.claude/CLAUDE.md](../.claude/CLAUDE.md).
- A preflight gate in [.agents/hooks/preflight_gate.py](../.agents/hooks/preflight_gate.py), one shared rule wired
  into every agent's hook surface, that actually blocks work rather than just asking for it, plus three hooks beside
  it in [.agents/hooks/](../.agents/hooks/): a reply formatting check, a markdown lint pass after an edit, and a
  task-list mirror that keeps the session plan alive across a compaction.
- MCP servers in five real config files, one per agent surface.
- OpenSpec, optional, for spec-driven feature work.

### Importing the standards

The standards arrive through a Git selective checkout. Only production-ready folders and the one template file are
pulled. The remote is read-only: its push URL is set to an invalid address, so you can pull updates but never push.

#### Step 0, prerequisites

Git pulls the files. Python 3 runs the hooks: every script in [.agents/hooks/](../.agents/hooks/) is Python, and
every wiring throws a failed call away so a broken hook can never break a session, which means a missing interpreter
reads as an allow. The gate is then wired and disarmed, silently. Check it before you rely on it. PowerShell:

```powershell
python --version
```

Unix shell:

```bash
python3 --version
```

Node is needed only for OpenCode and Kilo Code, whose gate adapter is
[.agents/plugin/hooks.js](../.agents/plugin/hooks.js), loaded by their own runtime. The other three agents need none.

Windows also needs symlinks. Three paths in this setup are symlinks (`.claude/skills`, `.opencode/agents`,
`.kilo/agents`). Without symlink support git writes them as ordinary text files holding the target path, and the
agents that depend on them silently see nothing. Turn on Developer Mode (Settings, System, For developers), then tell
git to honour symlinks, from inside the project you are importing into. PowerShell:

```powershell
git config core.symlinks true
```

Unix shell:

```bash
git config core.symlinks true
```

Adding `--global` to that command sets it for every repository on the machine, including clones you have not made
yet, which is the form to use if you import the standards into more than one project.

#### Step 1, initial import

Add the read-only remote. PowerShell or Unix shell, same command:

```bash
git remote add agent-standards https://github.com/Lukk17/agent-standards
```

Block pushes to it:

```bash
git remote set-url --push agent-standards no_push
```

Fetch:

```bash
git fetch agent-standards
```

Pull the production-ready paths:

```bash
git checkout agent-standards/master -- .agents .claude .opencode .kilo .codex .github/agents .github/hooks .vscode/mcp.json .mcp.json .github/mcp.json opencode.json docs/AGENT_TOOLING.md docs/MCP_SETUP.md docs/GLOBAL_SETUP.md docs/AGENTS-UPDATE.md AGENTS.md.example
```

Rename the one template. PowerShell:

```powershell
Rename-Item AGENTS.md.example AGENTS.md
```

Unix shell:

```bash
mv AGENTS.md.example AGENTS.md
```

Then ignore the agent task list. `.agents/hooks/task_list_sync.py` mirrors the live session task list into `tasks.md`
at the project root so the plan survives a compaction, and that file is per-session working state rather than shared
history. PowerShell:

```powershell
Add-Content .gitignore "`n/tasks.md"
```

Unix shell:

```bash
printf '\n/tasks.md\n' >> .gitignore
```

That is the whole setup. Commit when you are ready.

What you just pulled:

- [.agents/skills/](../.agents/skills/), the canonical skills, plus [.agents/agents/](../.agents/agents/), the shared
  OpenCode-format subagents, [.agents/hooks/](../.agents/hooks/), the four hook scripts, and
  [.agents/plugin/hooks.js](../.agents/plugin/hooks.js), the OpenCode and Kilo adapter for the gate.
- [.claude/](../.claude/): the `CLAUDE.md` bridge, the `skills` symlink, the generated `agents/` tree, and
  `settings.json` carrying the Claude Code hooks.
- `.opencode/agents` and `.kilo/agents`: symlinks into [.agents/agents/](../.agents/agents/). One tree, two agents.
- [.codex/](../.codex/): the generated TOML custom agents and `config.toml`, which holds both the Codex MCP servers
  and the Codex gate hooks inline.
- [.github/agents/](../.github/agents/) and [.github/hooks/preflight.json](../.github/hooks/preflight.json): Copilot
  subagents and its hook configuration.
- [.mcp.json](../.mcp.json), [opencode.json](../opencode.json), [.vscode/mcp.json](../.vscode/mcp.json), and
  [.github/mcp.json](../.github/mcp.json): the remaining MCP config files. These are real files, ready to use, not
  templates.
- The shipped documents: [AGENT_TOOLING.md](AGENT_TOOLING.md), [MCP_SETUP.md](MCP_SETUP.md),
  [GLOBAL_SETUP.md](GLOBAL_SETUP.md), and [AGENTS-UPDATE.md](AGENTS-UPDATE.md), plus
  [AGENTS.md.example](../AGENTS.md.example) to rename.

What you did not pull, and never will: the `subagents/` canonical source and the `tools/` generator. Both stay
upstream.

Verify the symlinks survived before you go further. PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-Item .claude/skills, .opencode/agents, .kilo/agents | Select-Object Name, LinkType, Target
```

Unix shell:

```bash
ls -l .claude/skills .opencode/agents .kilo/agents
```

If any of them came through as a small text file instead of a link, go back to Step 0 and redo the checkout.

#### Step 2, pulling future updates

[docs/AGENTS-UPDATE.md](AGENTS-UPDATE.md) ships from upstream, holds the per-shell update commands, and refreshes
itself on every run. Open it and run the block for your shell. It refreshes the shipped documents, all four hook
scripts and the plugin, the Copilot hook file, and only the skills and subagents already present in your tree.
Nothing new appears behind your back.

It deliberately leaves your `AGENTS.md`, your five MCP config files, `.claude/settings.json`, and `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
alone. Those are yours. When you do want an upstream change in one of the configuration files, each shell section of
that document ends with a diff command and a checkout for all five, and
[what this skips](AGENTS-UPDATE.md#what-this-skips-and-why) names which half of each file is yours.

### The preflight gate

The `## Required opening move` section of [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) is the canonical rule: before code work, name the
skills and subagents that own the task and invoke them, or say none apply and why. A rule read once at session start
loses its grip over a long session, so the gate is also enforced mechanically.

One shared script does the deciding, [.agents/hooks/preflight_gate.py](../.agents/hooks/preflight_gate.py). It reads
the hook payload and denies three things:

- A write of any file that resolves inside the repository working tree, coming straight from the main thread.
  Markdown, configuration, and the docs tree carry no exemption any more, so the main thread delegates every source,
  doc, and config change to a subagent that owns the area. A relative path is resolved against whatever a leading
  `cd` in the command moved to, so changing directory first does not get a write past it. A write outside the
  repository, the null device, `tasks.md` at the project root, and switching a git branch stay allowed, so the main
  thread keeps full use of git and keeps ownership of its own task list.
- Any tool call, not only an edit, from a subagent whose own definition declares no skills. Spawn a specialist that
  names its skills instead.
- A web fetch or web search called straight from the main thread, on the one format whose payload names that tool
  today, Claude Code. Spawn a subagent to do the research and report back instead.

Caller identity is a tri-state, not a boolean: a subagent, the main thread, or unknown, when a format's own payload
carries nothing that could tell the two apart. None of the three rules fires on an unknown caller, because denying
blind would block a legitimate subagent as often as it blocks the main thread. Every error path also allows the
call, because a gate that breaks a session is worse than no gate.

Each agent wires that same script through its own hook surface:

| Agent | Where the hooks live | What it can stop |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | [.claude/settings.json](../.claude/settings.json) | blocks the tool call, injects the gate at session start and every turn, lints markdown after an edit, blocks a reply on `Stop` and `SubagentStop`, and mirrors the task list |
| Codex | inline `[[hooks.*]]` tables in [.codex/config.toml](../.codex/config.toml) | blocks the tool call, injects the gate every turn and on subagent start, runs the formatting check on `Stop`, and seeds the task list at session start |
| OpenCode | plugin [.agents/plugin/hooks.js](../.agents/plugin/hooks.js), declared in [opencode.json](../opencode.json) | blocks the tool call |
| Kilo Code | the same plugin, the same declaration | blocks the tool call |
| GitHub Copilot | [.github/hooks/preflight.json](../.github/hooks/preflight.json) | fires on the tool call but always allows, caller identity is always unknown there; injects the gate once per session and on subagent start |

Only Claude Code has task events, so `tasks.md` is written from them there and merely injected at session start
elsewhere. Nothing has a task-updated event, so the hook writes only `open` and `done` and the model sets
`in progress` and `blocked` by editing the file, which is why that one path is exempt from the write rule above.

Every one of those wirings anchors the gate at the project root before calling it. A session started in a subdirectory
used to resolve the relative script path to nothing, and Python exits 2 when it cannot open the file it was handed,
which is the deny code, so the gate blocked every tool call instead of allowing them. Claude Code uses
`${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}`, Codex resolves the git root, Copilot sets `"cwd": "."`, and the plugin takes the runtime's
`worktree`. A missing or broken script now allows: the three JSON formats deny with exit 0 on stdout and never use a
non-zero exit, so any non-zero exit is an error and is thrown away, and the plugin reads each hook file before spawning
it.

Two limits are worth knowing before you trust the gate too far. GitHub Copilot's pre-tool payload carries no agent
identifier at all, so caller identity there resolves to unknown and none of the three rules ever fires on
`preToolUse`: that surface runs with the gate entirely unenforced, not merely weaker. OpenCode and Kilo Code have no
event that can block a reply, so on those two the enforcement is the pre-tool block plus per-agent tool permissions
and nothing after the fact. Claude Code is the only surface that can stop a finished reply.

Codex loads its whole `.codex/` layer, hooks included, only after you trust the project once.

---

### Subagents

Subagents are specialised agents the main session delegates to. One canonical file per agent fans out to four trees:
[.claude/agents/](../.claude/agents/) in Claude markdown, [.agents/agents/](../.agents/agents/) in OpenCode markdown,
[.codex/agents/](../.codex/agents/) in TOML, and [.github/agents/](../.github/agents/) as `*.agent.md`. OpenCode and
Kilo Code both read the OpenCode format and both follow symlinks when scanning an agent directory, so `.opencode/agents`
and `.kilo/agents` are symlinks into the shared tree rather than two more copies. Claude Code, Codex, and Copilot each
need their own format, which is why the other three trees exist at all.

These are generated artifacts. Do not hand-edit them, your changes vanish on the next pull. To change a subagent
for good, edit its canonical source in the agent-standards repository (`subagents/<name>.md`), run
`python tools/gen_subagents.py` there, and re-import through Step 2.

The catalogue covers code review, architecture, debugging, stack specialists (Java, Python, Flutter, Angular, React
and Next.js), DevOps, databases, APIs, security, design, accessibility, documentation, content, and legal drafting.

List what you have. PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem .agents/agents -Name
```

Unix shell:

```bash
ls .agents/agents
```

---

### GitHub Copilot

Copilot reads this setup natively across its surfaces, so it needs no bridge instruction file.

- Skills: read from [.agents/skills/](../.agents/skills/) natively in VS Code, the JetBrains plugin, the CLI, and
  the cloud agent. No symlink, no copy.
- Subagents: [.github/agents/](../.github/agents/) as `*.agent.md`, generated from the same canonical sources as
  every other tree.
- Instructions: [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) is read natively by VS Code agent mode, the CLI, and the cloud agent.
  The JetBrains plugin reads it in agent mode too, per the March 2026 JetBrains changelog, even though GitHub's own
  published support matrix still leaves JetBrains out of the `AGENTS.md` column. The behaviour is real, the
  documentation is behind. Add a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` yourself only if you target Copilot code review or
  the editors that read nothing else (Visual Studio, Xcode, Eclipse).
- MCP: Copilot in VS Code reads [.vscode/mcp.json](../.vscode/mcp.json), key `servers`. The Copilot CLI reads its
  own [.github/mcp.json](../.github/mcp.json), key `mcpServers` but no substitution syntax. The CLI's own
  documentation also names the project [.mcp.json](../.mcp.json) Claude Code uses as a valid source, and when both
  exist and name the same server, as all five do here, the CLI's precedence rule makes `.mcp.json` win, so see
  [MCP_SETUP.md](MCP_SETUP.md#the-cli-mcpjson-and-why-a-fifth-file-exists) before assuming `.github/mcp.json` is the
  file actually in effect. The JetBrains plugin reads a global file only, and the cloud agent takes JSON pasted into
  a repository settings page. Both manual blocks are in [MCP_SETUP.md](MCP_SETUP.md).
- Preflight: [.github/hooks/preflight.json](../.github/hooks/preflight.json), camelCase events, injecting the gate
  on `sessionStart` and `subagentStart` and blocking on `preToolUse`. The pre-tool payload carries no agent
  identifier, so caller identity there resolves to unknown and none of the gate's rules ever fires on that hook: this
  surface runs entirely unenforced rather than merely weaker. Copilot in JetBrains fires only six events, has no
  subagent event, and reads hook configuration only from `.github/hooks/`.

---

### Invoking skills

Skills are invoked from inside the agent shell with slash syntax:

```text
/code-reviewer
```

```text
/security-review
```

```text
/coding-standards
```

Depending on the agent, the autocomplete may show `/name` or `/name.md`. Use whichever form yours offers. The full
catalogue is [.agents/skills/](../.agents/skills/), one directory per skill, each holding a `SKILL.md`.

---

### MCP servers

Five real config files ship the same five servers, one per agent surface:

| File | Schema key | Serves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [.mcp.json](../.mcp.json) | `mcpServers` | Claude Code |
| [opencode.json](../opencode.json) | `mcp` | OpenCode and Kilo Code |
| [.codex/config.toml](../.codex/config.toml) | `[mcp_servers.*]` | Codex |
| [.vscode/mcp.json](../.vscode/mcp.json) | `servers` | GitHub Copilot in VS Code |
| [.github/mcp.json](../.github/mcp.json) | `mcpServers` | the GitHub Copilot CLI |

Only the file name, the schema key, the `type` value, and the environment-variable syntax differ between them.
Nothing needs renaming, they arrive ready to use. The Copilot CLI also reads the project `.mcp.json` above, and its
own precedence rule makes that file win whenever both name the same server, which is true for all five servers
here, so [.github/mcp.json](../.github/mcp.json) ships correct and is currently shadowed, see
[MCP_SETUP.md](MCP_SETUP.md#the-cli-mcpjson-and-why-a-fifth-file-exists) for the measurement. Two Copilot surfaces
get no file at all, the JetBrains plugin because it reads a global path only, and the cloud agent because its
configuration lives in a repository settings page.

Kilo Code accepts `opencode.json` as a project config filename, which is how one file serves both it and OpenCode.
Kilo is unforgiving about substitution in that file. A `{env:VAR}` anywhere in project-level config makes it reject
the file outright, taking the MCP servers and the `plugin` array that declares the preflight gate with it, so the
shipped file carries no references at all. Local servers inherit their tokens from the environment that started the
agent. The Context7 API key cannot be inherited, since it is an HTTP header, so `context7` ships unauthenticated on
the free tier and a paid key goes in your own global config. Details in [MCP_SETUP.md](MCP_SETUP.md).

The full human setup, prerequisites, key acquisition, environment variables per operating system, the two manual
Copilot blocks, and verification, lives in [MCP_SETUP.md](MCP_SETUP.md). A person does that once per machine, not the
agent.

---

### OpenSpec integration

OpenSpec is a spec-driven workflow: propose a change, let the agent write the tasks, apply them, then archive the
result into living specifications. It is optional, and it is entirely a consumer concern. The agent-standards
repository ships no `openspec-*` skills of its own.

#### Initialising it

Install it globally. PowerShell:

```powershell
npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest
```

Unix shell:

```bash
npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest
```

Initialise with the vendor-neutral target, and only that one. PowerShell:

```powershell
openspec init --tools agents
```

Unix shell:

```bash
openspec init --tools agents
```

`--tools agents` writes OpenSpec's skills into `.agents/skills/` and creates no per-tool directories. That single
target covers every agent here, because Codex, OpenCode, Kilo Code, and Copilot all read `.agents/skills/` natively
and Claude Code reaches the same files through its `.claude/skills` symlink. Any per-tool target would fragment a
layout built to have exactly one skills directory.

Avoid `--tools kilocode` in particular. OpenSpec 1.10.0 still hardcodes the old `.kilocode` directory for its Kilo
target, and Kilo Code has since moved its configuration root to `.kilo`, so that target writes into a directory
nothing reads.

What the init creates:

```text
openspec/
  config.yaml              OpenSpec project config
  specs/                   living documentation of your system
  changes/                 active feature work
    archive/               completed changes
.agents/skills/openspec-workflow/SKILL.md
.agents/skills/openspec-specs/SKILL.md
```

Restart your editor and terminal afterwards so the new skills are picked up.

Slash-command names still vary per agent, because command formats genuinely differ between tools. Agents that read
flat command files show `/opsx-propose.md`; agents with native skill integration show `/opsx:propose`. Use whichever
appears in your autocomplete.

#### Optional, a custom schema for end-to-end capability tests

For projects that want spec-driven end-to-end capability tests inside the OpenSpec lifecycle, install the
[e2e-runbooks](https://github.com/Lukk17/openspec-schemas/tree/master/openspec/schemas/e2e-runbooks) schema from the
companion repository. OpenSpec has no schema-install command yet, so you fetch the bundle straight into
`openspec/schemas/`, which is the same path it occupies upstream, so nothing has to be moved afterwards. Your project
has to be a git repository with OpenSpec already initialised, and both commands run from the project root.

Fetch the schema from `master`. Its only tag, `v0.1.0`, predates the move to `openspec/schemas/` and still keeps the
bundle at the repository root, so the tag and the path below do not line up. PowerShell:

```powershell
git fetch --depth 1 https://github.com/Lukk17/openspec-schemas master
```

Unix shell:

```bash
git fetch --depth 1 https://github.com/Lukk17/openspec-schemas master
```

Write only the schema directory into your tree. PowerShell:

```powershell
git checkout FETCH_HEAD -- openspec/schemas/e2e-runbooks
```

Unix shell:

```bash
git checkout FETCH_HEAD -- openspec/schemas/e2e-runbooks
```

The 13 files land in your working tree and staged at the same time. Review with `git diff --staged`, then commit. To
upgrade later, re-run the same pair.

Use it for one change. The `change` subcommand is required and `--schema` is an option on it. PowerShell:

```powershell
openspec new change "add-weather-mcp-test" --schema e2e-runbooks
```

Unix shell:

```bash
openspec new change "add-weather-mcp-test" --schema e2e-runbooks
```

Or make it the project default in `openspec/config.yaml` and drive it with `/opsx:propose`:

```yaml
default_schema: e2e-runbooks
```

The methodology behind the schema is documented in the
[e2e-runbooks skill](../.agents/skills/e2e-runbooks/SKILL.md). Either works alone, and they reinforce each other.

---

### OpenSpec workflow

Start the agent:

```bash
claude
```

Propose a change:

```text
/opsx:propose add dark mode support
```

The agent writes the proposal, the design, and the task list under `openspec/changes/`. Review the generated
`tasks.md`, edit it directly or have the agent revise it, then apply:

```text
/opsx:apply
```

The agent writes the code and ticks the boxes in `tasks.md`. When something breaks, hand the evidence back:

```text
/opsx:verify The toggle button is invisible on mobile. Fix it.
```

Archive when it is done:

```text
/opsx:archive
```

The agent merges the delta specifications into `openspec/specs/` and moves the change folder into
`openspec/changes/archive/`.
